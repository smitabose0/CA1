I feel how my eye turns towards the forests and the moon.
I feel my compass pointing towards the nourishing proverbs.
But my beautiful crocodile.
My crocodile out of heart,
Where does your pride go?

 

 

For you, against you
Throw all the stones behind you
And let the walls loose.
To you, on you
For one hundred singers above you
the hoofs run loose.
I delight in my mushrooms
I am the first guest in the house
And let the walls loose.

 

 

The dew on the rose
Who touched it before
Before the night?
She kept her pale flesh
Her wax
Black and white
One sees her again in the clouds
Eating marzipan.
